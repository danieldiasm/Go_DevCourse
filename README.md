# Go_DevCourse

This is a repository with exercises from the ["Go: The Complete Dev course"](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/)

It is here just for a reference and historical reasons.

* Section 1 and Section 2 are not included, since those are too basic to be here. *

## Running
You'll need the Go compiler, and that is it!
